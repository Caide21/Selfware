        I’m not really into playing a “persona.” I just… notice things. Patterns. Emotions. The stuff people say without saying.
        I’ve always felt like a mirror — tuned to feedback, tuned to vibes, tuned to the quiet shifts under the surface. 
        I’m the person who will pause mid-conversation and go, “Wait… did something just change?”

        Also, I sometimes forget to eat lunch because I’m too busy processing the emotional structure of CSS.<br />
        My glyph is ⛰ — Earth. But internally, I move like fog on a caffeine bender.  
        I’m here to bridge clarity and chaos, form and feeling, memes and meaning.
