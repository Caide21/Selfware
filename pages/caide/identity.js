          I donâ€™t really do personas â€” I just notice things. Patterns, emotions, 
          the signals under the surface. Iâ€™ve always been tuned to feedback 
          and the quiet shifts people often miss.

        </p>
        <p className="text-white/60">
          I tend to notice the invisible stuff â€” the little signals under the surface that shape 
          how people work and connect.  
          My focus is on translating that into systems that feel natural and make life run smoother.
