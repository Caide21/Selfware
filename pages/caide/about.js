          Iâ€™ve always been drawn to how systems actually feel to use â€” the small
          signals that change whether something helps or gets in the way.
          That focus came from real constraints and a lot of trial and error.
        </p>
        <p className="text-white/60">
          Getting sick young forced me to pay attention to patterns:
          energy, friction, momentum. I learned to notice what compounds and
          what leaks. That became a way of building â€” make the useful parts
          obvious, remove the rest, and keep iterating.
        </p>
        <p className="text-white/60">
          Selfware is the result: a simple, practical layer for context.
          Track progress, see patterns, and make better decisions with clarity.
          No theatrics â€” just tools that help you move forward.
