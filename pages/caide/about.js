          I was sick for a long time. Not the kind you can always explain â€” the kind that rewires how you experience everything.  
          That taught me to listen. To patterns. To friction. To moments that didnâ€™t make sense but still mattered.  
          Now I build tools that actually <em>respond</em> â€” to how you feel, how you move, and where you're headed.
